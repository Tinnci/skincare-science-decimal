= The "Percentage-Chasing" Trend
The skincare industry often chases high active percentages (e.g., 10% or higher Niacinamide), implying "more is better." However, regulatory and scientific data suggest otherwise.
- *Recommended Range:* Ingredient suppliers typically recommend *0.5% - 5%*.
- *Clinical Evidence:* Most studies demonstrating benefits (barrier repair, pigment reduction, acne control) used concentrations *below 5%*.
- *Diminishing Returns:* There is no reliable evidence that concentrations above 5% provide significantly better results.
- *Irritation Risk:* Higher concentrations increase the risk of irritation. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) based its safety assessment on data where 3% was the maximum used (in 2001), though safe use is generally accepted. However, toxicity studies focus on standard levels; extreme percentages (e.g., mixing raw powder) lack safety data.

= Myth: Niacinamide vs. Vitamin C
A persistent internet rumor claims Niacinamide cannot be used with Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid).
- *Status:* **Debunked.**
- *Reality:* Niacinamide acts as a great stabilizer and antioxidant. It is compatible with Vitamin C. Some sunscreens (e.g., SunSense) even formulate with 3% Niacinamide alongside other actives.

= Usage & Compatibility
- *Versatility:* Niacinamide is stable, pH-neutral, and non-oxidizing, making it compatible with almost all routine steps (Retinoids, Acids, Sunscreen).
- *In Sunscreen:* It is an excellent addition to sunscreens due to its photostability and immune-protective properties.
