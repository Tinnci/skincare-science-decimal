= The Concept: Raw Ingredient Powders
Brands like The Ordinary have released 100% Niacinamide and 100% L-Ascorbic Acid powders, encouraging consumers to mix them into other products. While this appears cost-effective and "pure," it presents significant formulation and safety risks.

= Why It Is Not Recommended
1.  *Dosing Inaccuracy:*
    - Humans cannot accurately measure milligram-level doses by volume (e.g., "a quarter scoop").
    - A standard scoop varies wildly based on packing density (fluffy vs. packed).
    - *Risk:* Accidentally using 20% or 30% concentration instead of 5% is easy, leading to irritation or chemical burns (especially with acidic Vitamin C).
2.  *Solubility & Texture:*
    - "Crystallization" on the skin is uncontrolled. Inconsistent mixing can lead to hot spots of high concentration.
3.  *pH Issues (For Vitamin C):*
    - L-Ascorbic Acid is highly acidic. Commercial serums adjust pH to a safe level (via buffers like Sodium Hydroxide or Baking Soda).
    - Mixing raw powder into a neutral cream creates an unchecked, potentially extremely acidic mixture that can damage the skin barrier.
4.  *Lack of Formulation:*
    - Proper formulation involves ensuring ingredients are stable, soluble, and bioavailable. Raw powders bypass these critical steps.

= Conclusion
"Playing chemist" in the palm of your hand bypasses safety checks. It is safer and more effective to use formulated products with known concentrations (e.g., 5% Niacinamide) rather than risking irritation with raw powders.
