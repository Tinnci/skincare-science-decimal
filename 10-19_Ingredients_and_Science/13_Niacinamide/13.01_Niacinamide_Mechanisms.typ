= What is Niacinamide?
Niacinamide (Vitamin B3 or Nicotinamide) is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally found in the skin. It acts as a precursor to important enzyme co-factors (NADP/NADPH), meaning many biological processes in the skin rely on it to function correctly.

= Core Benefits & Mechanisms
Scientific studies support a wide range of benefits for Niacinamide:
- *Barrier Repair:* It increases the production of ceramides and other stratum corneum lipids, helping to maintain the skin barrier and prevent Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL).
- *Anti-Inflammatory:* It reduces skin sensitivity and redness, making it useful for conditions like rosacea and acne.
- *Sebum Regulation:* It can help regulate excess sebum production, particularly in oily skin types.
- *Pigment Reduction:* It inhibits the transfer of melanosomes (pigment packets) from melanocytes to keratinocytes, thereby reducing hyperpigmentation and skin darkening.
- *Anti-Aging:* It may improve skin texture, reduce yellowing (sallowness), and smooth fine lines.

= Clinical Evidence
Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for:
- Reducing hyperpigmentation (e.g., axillary darkening).
- Improving barrier function in dry skin.
- Managing acne and seborrheic dermatitis.
- Reducing red blotchiness and improving skin tone.
