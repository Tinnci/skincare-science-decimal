  title: "Derivatives: ATIP vs. THDA",
  doc_id: "12.03",

= The Identity Crisis
Two common oil-soluble Vitamin C derivatives are often marketed as distinct ingredients:
- *ATIP:* Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate (often labeled as "VC-IP").
- *THDA:* Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate.
Marketing often implies THDA is a "cheaper knockoff" of the superior ATIP.

= Chemical Stability & Structure
Both molecules consist of an Ascorbic Acid core attached to four C16 fatty acids via ester linkages.
- *Isomers:* The confusion arises because the fatty acids (Palmitic, Isopalmitic, 2-hexyldecanoic) are isomers (same molecular weight, different arrangement).
- *The Evidence:* Analysis of patents (Nikkol Group) and supplier data (Greaf, Sytheon) reveals that the ingredient supplied as "ATIP" is actually *Structure C* (Ascorbyl tetra-2-hexyldecanoate).
- *THDA:* This name corresponds directly to *Structure C*.

= Conclusion
Despite marketing claims suggesting otherwise, detailed chemical analysis suggests **ATIP and THDA are the same molecule** (Ascorbyl tetra-2-hexyldecanoate) in the context of cosmetic raw materials.
- *Marketing Implication:* Brands claiming ATIP is superior to THDA are likely making a distinction without a chemical difference.
- *Performance:* Both are chemically identical and share the same efficacy/stability profile.
