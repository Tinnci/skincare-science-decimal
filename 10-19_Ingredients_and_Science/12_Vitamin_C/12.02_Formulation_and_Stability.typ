= The Instability Problem
Despite its efficacy, L-Ascorbic Acid is notoriously unstable. In the presence of water, light, oxygen, and high pH, it oxidizes rapidly.
- *Degradation Path:* Ascorbic Acid $->$ Dehydroascorbic Acid (DHA) $->$ Breakdown products (including Erythrulose).
- *Visible Signs:* The serum turns yellow, then orange, then brown.
- *Staining:* One breakdown product, *Erythrulose*, is a common ingredient in fake tans, which explains why oxidized Vitamin C can stain skin and fingers orange/brown.

= 1. The "Duke Patent" Parameters
Scientific consensus suggests effective delivery generally requires specific boundaries, often referred to as the "Duke Parameters" (based on Dr. Sheldon Pinnell's research):
- *Concentration:* 10% - 20%. (Limits of solubility vs. irritation).
- *pH:* Acidic pH of 2.0 - 3.5.
- *Why Low pH?* It ensures the molecule remains uncharged (protonated), allowing it to penetrate the skin barrier. It also inhibits auto-oxidation.

= 2. Commercial Strategies
Formulators use several strategies to combat instability, with varying success:
- *Water-Based Antioxidant Cocktails:* The "Gold Standard" (e.g., Skinceuticals CE Ferulic) stabilizes AA with Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid.
- *Anhydrous (Water-Free) Suspensions:* Suspending AA powder in silicone or oil prevents oxidation (since ions don't mobile without water). *Trade-off:* Can be gritty; requires the powder to dissolve in skin's natural moisture to work.
- *Anhydrous Solutions (Polyols):* Dissolving AA in solvents like Propanediol (e.g., Matter of Fact). *Critique:* Propanediol is hygroscopic (attracts water), which can eventually lead to degradation if not perfectly sealed.

= 3. The DIY Solution: Freshness Over Stability
Because commercial stabilization is difficult and expensive, "Fresh DIY" is a scientifically valid alternative.
- *Logic:* By making small batches weekly, you assume it will act as a preservative-free, fresh solution before significant degradation occurs.
- *The "Cristallization" Myth:* Critics claim rapid evaporation of water leaves solid crystals on skin that don't absorb. *Counter-evidence:* Studies suggest solid micro-crystals can still deliver AA to the skin over time via naturally evaporating transepidermal water (TEWL).

== Basic DIY Recipe (Lab Muffin)
- *Ratio:* Calculate LAA powder needed for 10-20% concentration (e.g., 2g LAA for 20mL total).
- *Solvent:* Distilled water (removes metal ions that catalyze oxidation).
- *pH Adjustment:* Use Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate) carefully to raise pH to ~3.5 (prevents excessive irritation).
- *Storage:* Light-proof container (foil-wrapped), cool place. Discard after 1-2 weeks.
