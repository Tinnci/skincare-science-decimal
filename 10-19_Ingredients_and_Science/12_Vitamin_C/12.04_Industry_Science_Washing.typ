= What is "Science-Washing"?
Science-washing is the practice of adopting the aesthetics of science (graphs, chemical structures, citation lists) without adhering to scientific rigor. It is used to lend credibility to marketing claims.

= Case Study: "Unmatched Stability" Claims
A recent brand ("Matter of Fact") marketed a Vitamin C serum claiming "unmatched stability" with "breakthrough technology."
- *The Comparison:* They compared their *anhydrous* (water-free) serum against a *water-based* "gold standard" serum.
- *The Flaw:* Anhydrous formulas are inherently more stable than water-based ones. Comparing the two to claim "superior technology" is misleading (Apples vs. Oranges). There are many existing stable anhydrous formulas (e.g., silicone suspensions).
- *Accelerated Testing:* The brand relied on accelerated stability testing (high heat for short time) to predict long-term shelf life (2 years). For temperature-sensitive molecules like Ascorbic Acid, this extrapolation is often inaccurate.

= Breakdown Myths: Erythrulose
Marketing often simplifies complex chemical degradation.
- *The Claim:* Ascorbic Acid degrades in a simple 3-step process into *only* Erythrulose, which causes the specific red-brown color.
- *The Reality:* Degradation is a complex multi-pathway process yielding many products. Pure Erythrulose is pale yellow/clear. The deep brown color of oxidized Vitamin C comes from a complex mix of polymerization products, not just Erythrulose.

= The Patent "Breakthrough"
Marketing often frames known chemistry as new discovery.
- *The Tech:* Dissolving high concentrations (20%) of Ascorbic Acid in Polyols (like Propanediol) using Urea as a co-solvent.
- *Prior Art:* Patents from 2007 already describe using Urea to increase Ascorbic Acid solubility in polyols. Re-branding this as a "new discovery" is a form of science-washing.
