Retinoids are a class of chemical compounds that are vitamers of vitamin A or are chemically related to it. In dermatology, they are classified into four distinct scientific generations based on their molecular structure and receptor selectivity.

== Classification by Generation

=== First Generation (Non-aromatic)
These are naturally occurring retinoids that are non-selective in their binding.
- *Tretinoin (All-trans retinoic acid):* The "gold standard" for photoaging and acne. Direct action on receptors.
- *Retinol:* Requires two conversion steps (Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid).
- *Retinaldehyde (Retinal):* Requires only one conversion step, making it more potent than retinol but gentler than tretinoin.
- *Isotretinoin:* Primarily used for severe acne (oral).

=== Second Generation (Mono-aromatic)
Synthetic retinoids where the polar end group is replaced by an aromatic ring.
- *Etretinate & Acitretin:* Primarily used for psoriasis.

=== Third Generation (Poly-aromatic)
Designed to be more receptor-selective and stable.
- *Adapalene:* Selective for RAR-beta and RAR-gamma. Highly stable and commonly used for acne.
- *Tazarotene:* Selective for RAR-beta and RAR-gamma. Highly potent, often used for hyperpigmentation and psoriasis.

=== Fourth Generation
- *Trifarotene:* The most recent FDA-approved retinoid. Highly selective for the *RAR-gamma* subtype, which is the predominant receptor in the epidermis.

=== "Fifth Generation" (Marketing Terminology)
In the cosmetic industry, certain new derivatives like *Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate (HPR)* or "Granactive Retinoid" are sometimes marketed as "fifth generation," though this is not yet a formal scientific classification. These are designed to bind directly to receptors while minimizing irritation.

== Historical Context: The Cosmetic vs. Drug Divide

The distinction between cosmetic retinol and prescription retinoids is often a "historical accident":
- *Origins:* Retinol was already used in cosmetics for antioxidant properties before its role as a *prodrug of retinoic acid* (Tretinoin) was fully understood (Kang & Voorhees).
- *Regulation:* Because it was already in the market at lower concentrations, the FDA maintained its status as a cosmetic rather than reclassifying it as a drug.
- *Prodrug Path:* 
  $ "Retinol" -> "Retinaldehyde" -> "Retinoic Acid (Tretinoin)" $
  Retinol must be converted in the skin to exert its biological effects through Retinoic Acid Receptors.

== Potency vs. Tolerability
The path to Retinoic Acid determines both the speed of results and the risk of "retinization" (irritation):
$ "Retinyl Palmitate" -> "Retinol" -> "Retinaldehyde" -> "Retinoic Acid" $
Each step reduces potency but generally improves user tolerance.
