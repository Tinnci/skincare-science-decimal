#v(1em)

Retinoids exert their biological effects by binding to specific nuclear receptors. These receptors act as transcription factors, regulating the expression of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

== Retinoic Acid Receptors (RARs)

There are three primary subtypes of RARs located in the skin:

- *RAR-alpha (RARα):* Distributed throughout the epidermis and dermis.
- *RAR-beta (RARβ):* Found primarily in the dermis.
- *RAR-gamma (RARγ):* The most abundant subtype in the epidermis (approx. 90% of RARs in human skin).

== Receptor Selectivity of Common Retinoids

| Retinoid | Receptor Affinity | Clinical Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Tretinoin* | Pan-agonist (α, β, γ) | General anti-aging, acne |
| *Adapalene* | Selective (β, γ) | Acne, comedolysis |
| *Tazarotene* | Selective (β, γ) | Psoriasis, Hyperpigmentation |
| *Trifarotene* | Highly Selective (γ) | Acne, Truncal acne |

== Association with Hyperpigmentation

Both *RARα* and *RARγ* are significantly associated with the treatment of hyperpigmentation:

1. *Cell Turnover:* RAR activation stimulates keratinocyte proliferation, accelerating the "shedding" of melanin-containing cells.
2. *Melanogenesis Inhibition:* Retinoids can interfere with the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes and inhibit tyrosinase activity.
3. *RARγ Dominance:* Since RARγ is the predominant receptor in the epidermis where most pigment resides, selective agonists are particularly effective.

== Molecular Markers of Efficacy

Evidence that retinol is working at the cellular level includes:
- *Increased Collagen:* Stimulation of procollagen and inhibition of collagen-degrading MMPs (Matrix Metalloproteinases).
- *CRABP-II Induction:* Increased levels of Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein-II.
- *Hyaluronan Production:* Induction of HAS (Hyaluronan Synthase) genes.
- *Epidermal Thickening:* Also known as hyperplasia.

== The EGF Pathway & "Retinization"

RAR activation triggers the *Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)* pathway. This leads to:
- Rapid cell production in the top layers of the skin.
- *Hyperplasia:* The clinical "peeling" or "retinoid dermatitis" (retinization) often observed when starting retinoids. This is a unique side effect linked directly to the retinoid mechanism.
